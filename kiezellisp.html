<h1>The making of Kiezellisp</h1>
<p>In 2006 I decided to create a computer language suitable for web programming and
other things. The language should run on .NET and be better than PHP, Ruby and
Python.</p>
<p>In 2008 I published Clearlisp on SourceForge.net. It was mainly an exercise to
implement a syntactically simple language using .NET reflection. The Arc language
was published at the same time.</p>
<p>My next exercise was to use Lex and Yacc to create a syntactically complex
language called Rabbit. Rabbit was meant to be the semi-colon and braces embracing
alternative to Ruby and Python, for C-lovers only. It was faster than ClearLisp
because it used dynamic methods.</p>
<p>What happened that I did not publish it?</p>
<p>Javascript happened. This doesn't make sense chronologically. But I learned about
the prototype object model and I liked it. I ripped out Rabbit's classical object
model and replaced it with a prototype object model. The result was javascript
and I did not like it.</p>
<p>Dynamic Language Runtime happened. Dynamic methods are not good enough anymore.
Cached and jitted methods are way faster.</p>
<p>I went back to lisp to avoid creating a javascript look-a-like and to reduce the
amount of DLR specific code needed to implement the language.</p>
