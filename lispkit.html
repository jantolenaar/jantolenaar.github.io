<h1>Lispkit</h1>
<p>I first heard of Lispkit in 1983 but I am not very sure about the year.
It was a long time ago and I have nothing to show, neither papers nor 8-
inch floppy disks.</p>
<p>Historical background... I studied mathematics at the
<a href="http://www.leiden.edu/">university of Leiden</a>. As a math major, I was required to have some
minor subjects too. One was about computers. Course material included a book
with the subtitle <em>Syntax and Semantics of Programming Languages</em>. It was about
finite automata and context free (or not) left/right recursive abstract
grammars.</p>
<p>In 1974 my understanding of computers was minimal. Personal computers
did not exist. Computers lived of stacks of punch cards and printed
listings on chained paper. I believed that the cost of just one minute
of computer time could buy a Christmas diner for a large family.</p>
<p>In those days abstract grammars were so abstract that the professor
had to tell you that they had to do with programming languages. And I
probably missed his introduction.</p>
<p>In 1980, after graduation, I got a job as an instructor at Sperry Univac.</p>
<p>One of my fellow instructors, Ben, had this great idea to build a microcomputer.
I liked the idea and spent a fortune on a <a href="http://www.nascomhomepage.com">NASCOM II</a>
microcomputer assembly kit. Getting a 4Mhz Z80A cpu, 48KB memory and a
tape cassette recorder to work was not only a challenge but also fun. The kit
enabled me to write programs in Basic, Pascal and Z80 assembly.</p>
<p>So one day Ben gave me a print-out of a manual (<a href="lispkit.pdf">not this
one</a>). He said I might find it interesting.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>The manual was (probably) Peter Henderson's <em>Functional Programming -
Application and Implementation</em> paper about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECD_machine">SECD virtual
machine</a>.</p>
<p>It took me three nights to write a Pascal implementation of a compiler
for the Lispkit SECD virtual machine. Later I rewrote it in Z80 assembly
language as a SECDB compiler. Just 4 Kb of machine code! The extra B
register made it possible to solve problems by backtracking. My NASCOM
was just big enough to solve to solve the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle">eight queens problem</a>.</p>
<p>After all this I finally understood <em>Syntax and Semantics of
Programming Languages</em>.</p>
