studied mathematics at the <a href="http://www.leiden.edu/">university of Leiden</a> and I live and work in
Leiden.</p>
<p>I run a one-person, Dutch company called Tolenaar IT Services providing
software development services.</p>
<p>My recent work involves Common Lisp, C#, MS-SQL and Yardi. My not so recent work
involved teaching, embedded software and multi-platform, multi-tiered
client/server development environments.</p>
<p>I have been working in IT as an instructor, consultant, developer and
architect for several companies, such as Sperry Univac (later Unisys)
and Pontis Research.</p>
<p>In 1973 I learned my first programming language: Algol. This was followed by Cobol,
Fortran, Z80, 68000, 80x86 and Univac OS1100 assembly languages,
Forth, Lisp, Pascal, Modula, PL/M, C, C++, C#, PHP, SQL, Java, Ruby,
Python and even Visual Basic.</p>
<p>Like many programmers interested in programming languages, I wrote my
share of interpreters and compilers. I did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECD_machine">Lispkit</a>, Forth and the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-C">Small C Compiler</a>. First on a <a href="http://www.nascomhomepage.com">NASCOM II</a> microcomputer, later on several
Atari's and PC's.</p>
<p>My other interests are chess, bridge, carom billiard, wing chun, biking and hiking.</p>
